Flexbox (Flexible Box Module) is designed to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.

## The Two Axes

The most important thing to likely understand is that Flexbox works on two axes: the **Main Axis** and the **Cross Axis**.

- **Main Axis**: Defined by `flex-direction`. If `row`, main axis is horizontal.
- **Cross Axis**: Perpendicular to the main axis.

## Justify Content vs Align Items

This is where beginners often get stuck:

- `justify-content` controls alignment along the **Main Axis**.
- `align-items` controls alignment along the **Cross Axis**.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Center horizontally (if row) */
  align-items: center;     /* Center vertically (if row) */
  height: 100vh;
}
```

## Flex Grow, Shrink, Basis

The shorthand `flex: 1` actually stands for:
- `flex-grow: 1`
- `flex-shrink: 1`
- `flex-basis: 0%`

Mastering these three properties gives you complete control over how elements resize to fill available space.
