React Server Components (RSC) are one of the most significant changes to the React ecosystem in years. They allow components to render exclusively on the server, reducing the bundle size sent to the client and enabling direct access to backend resources like databases.

## What are Server Components?

Unlike traditional React components (now called Client Components), Server Components never hydrate on the client. Their code isn't included in the JavaScript bundle.

```jsx
// This component runs ONLY on the server
import db from './database';

async function Note({ id }) {
  const note = await db.notes.get(id);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{note.title}</h2>
      <p>{note.body}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Why use them?

1.  **Zero Bundle Size**: Dependencies used in Server Components don't impact the user's download size.
2.  **Direct Backend Access**: Query your DB directly inside your component.
3.  **Automatic Code Splitting**: Client components imported by Server Components are automatically code-split.

## The Mental Model

Think of Server Components as the "skeleton" of your page, providing the static content and initial data. Client Components are the "muscles" – the interactive bits like buttons, inputs, and stateful widgets – that are slotted into that skeleton.

> "Server Components allow developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering."
