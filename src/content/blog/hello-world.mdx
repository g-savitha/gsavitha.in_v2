## Introduction

Building a portfolio is a rite of passage for every developer. It's not just about showcasing your work; it's about showing who you are.

For this version of my site, I wanted something that felt **premium**, **fast**, and a little bit **whimsical**—inspired by the wonderful sites of creators like Josh Comeau.

## Why Astro?

Astro is the perfect choice for a content-heavy site like a portfolio.

1. **Zero JS by default**: Interactive islands only where needed.
2. **Content Collections**: Type-safe markdown/MDX.
3. **View Transitions**: Built-in SPA-like navigation.

## The Stack

- **Astro** for the framework
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4!) for styling
- **React** for interactive components (like the sandbox)

```javascript
// Example of code snippet
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Stay tuned for more updates as I build out this site!
