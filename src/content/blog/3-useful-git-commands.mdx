In this article lets look at a few Git commands which every developer should be familiar with.

## What is Git?

> TL;DR: Git is a distributed version control system, which helps you keep track of changes you made to the code. You can consider it as a history tab in your browser. (Wait you use incongnito ? :flushed: )

I prefer to use git from command line as it gives me more control over what I'm doing than using Github desktop or some other GUI tools. So in this post, I'm going to refer using the git from command line.
