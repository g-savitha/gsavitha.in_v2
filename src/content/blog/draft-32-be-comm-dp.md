Hello there, fellow engineers! :wave:,

Whether you’re building APIs, handling microservices, or keeping servers humming, there are some concepts you’ve got to get cozy with.

Let's walkthrough a bunch of them

For any Backend Engineer, these are must:

1. Request response
2. Synchronous vs Asynchronous workloads
3. Push
4. Polling
5. Long Polling
6. Server sent events
7. Publish Subscribe(Pub/sub)
8. Multiplexing vs Demultiplexing(h2 proxying vs connection pooling)
9. Stateful vs Stateless
10. Sidecar pattern
