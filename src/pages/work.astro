After having joined the team & getting hold of the new code base, she never hesitated in making changes & suggested reforms to further grow the code.
In short time, she made a place for herself in the team & started owning the frontend repos with great command.
She's a quick learner, technically sound & active contributor; one wishes to work alongside with.

She is proactive, takes initiative, and consistently ensures that tasks are delivered on time with a high level of quality. When needed, she goes the extra mile—working beyond regular hours to address critical issues and meet deadlines. One of Savitha’s standout contributions has been her work on uplifting our frontend application (CWA). She successfully led the migration from React 16.x to React 19.x, transitioned the state management from Flux to Redux, and modernized the build process by moving from Gulp to Webpack. In addition to these upgrades, she made sure the application was fully responsive across devices, which greatly improved user experience. Her efforts also led to a measurable 20% performance improvement in the CAUI application—an achievement that had a significant impact on the overall system efficiency. She contributed to V4 structural changes as well, playing a key role in ensuring stability and scalability for future enhancements. Beyond frontend work, Savitha contributed to backend and infrastructure tasks such as Open Banking certificate renewals and engaged in in-depth discussions on architecture and system improvements. She consistently works beyond her level of experience, shows a strong drive to learn, and is always focused on upskilling herself. She is also a great team player—collaborative, detail-oriented, and always willing to mentor others and share her knowledge. I will strongly recommend Savitha for the forward thinking, reliable and full stack developer roles.",
